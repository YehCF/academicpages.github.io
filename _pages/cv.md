Work & Research Experience
======   

* **Project Investigator & Artificial Intelligence Researcher**, 04/2017-Present
  * _Service Systems Technology Center (SSTC), Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), Hsinchu, Taiwan_
  * Projects:
    1. **_AI-based Early-stage Glaucoma Detection with Fundus Images_**
      * Period: 01/2018-12/2019
      * Developed an encoder-decoder CNN to predict the retinal nerve fiber layer defects based on fundus
