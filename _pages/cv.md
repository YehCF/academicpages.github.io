Work & Research Experience
======
* **Project Investigator & Artificial Intelligence Researcher**, 04/2017-Present
  * _Dept. of Intelligent Medical & Healthcare System, Div. of Healthcare Service, Service Systems Technology Center, Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)_
  * Projects:
    1. **_AI-based Early-stage Glaucoma Detection with Fundus Images_**
      * Period: 01/2018-12/2018 
      * Build up a deep learning model to quantify the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) defects in fundus image
      * 1 conference paper 
    2. **_The Development of Medical Devices for COPD Exacerbation Development Monitoring_**
      * Period: 2017-2018
      * Design an innovative service system to help patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) detect acute exacerbation earlier by means of abnormal lung sound detection 
      * The model for lung sound detection (normal, wheeze, rhonchi and crackle) achieved 85.78% of accuracy, 5% higher than the accuracy reported in reference paper
      * 2 patents filed

* **Artificial Intelligence Researcher**, 01/2017 - Present
  * _Dept. of Intelligent Medical & Healthcare System, Div. of Healthcare Service, Service Systems Technology Center, Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI)_
  * Projects:
    1. **_Artificial Intelligence-based Diabetics Fundus Image Decision Support_**
      * Design an innovative system to prevent patients with diabetes from severe diabetic retinopathy
      * The kappa score between the model and the doctor was 84.15%, higher than that reported by Google and that of the 3th place of Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Challenge in Kaggle.
      * Currently, we collaborate with more than 3 hospitals to collect fundus images and annotate each image with possible DR lesions (microaneurysm, exudate, hemorrhage, neovascularization, etc). The results will be published soon.
