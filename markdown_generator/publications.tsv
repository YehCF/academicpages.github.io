Specifically, we compared postural control and goal- directed reaching performance between children with DS and typically developing children during standing reach. Standing reach performance was analyzed in three main phases using the kinematic and kinetic data collected from a force plate and a motion capture system. Fourteen children with DS, age and gender matched with fourteen typically developing children, were recruited for this study. The results showed that the demand of the standing reach task affected both dynamic postural control and reaching performance in children with DS, especially in the condition of beyond armÍs length reaching. More postural adjustment strategies were recruited when reaching distance was beyond armÍs length. Children with DS tended to use inefficient and conservative strategies for postural stability and reaching. That is, children with DS perform standing reach with increased reaction and execution time and decreased amplitudes of center of pressure displacements. Standing reach resembled functional balance that is required in daily activities. It is suggested to be considered as a part of strength and balance training program with graded task difficulty.

Currently, the tools or parameters, such as standard automated Perimetry and the cup-to-disc ratio derived from fundus images, can only screen out the glaucomatous patients whose ganglion cells in optic nerve have already lost about 50%. It would be meaningful to clinicians if the loss of optic nerve could be quantified in the early stage efficiently. For this purpose, the fundus images, which has a 45¡ field of view and encircle most of the optic nerve, should be leveraged and a deep learning-based algorithm should be developed to measure the RNFL defect. In this paper, the feasibility of early detection for retinal nerve fiber layer defect with fundus images in glaucoma patients is demonstrated. We built up a deep learning model to detect glaucomatous patients from healthy subjects with fundus images. The accuracy of the deep learning model for classification of Glaucoma patients was 90% and it could be seen that the model treated the features relevant to the retinal nerve fiber layer defect as the essential ones for discriminating glaucoma patients. From this experiment, it is promising to measure the severity of RNFL defects and locate them efficiently with fundus images and deep learning algorithms. Future studies would focus on development of an accurate deep learning-based algorithm, which may take visual field data as reference or labels, for retinal nerve fiber layer defect quantification."
